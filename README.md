# Classy

A webapp that stores Zoom links for University of Toronto courses, grabs course times using the Nikel API, and sends clickable push notifications when it's time for a class.
Users are also able to login to a central page with links to all of their Zoom courses, if they just want a hub to store their links along with class times.

This is the version that is currently being deployed on Heroku - unfortunately it looks like due to the limitations of free hosting, notifications will have to be removed for it.
